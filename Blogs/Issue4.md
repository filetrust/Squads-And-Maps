# Title: Using Jira tips and Squad communications

![image](Pictures/BlogIssue4.png)

Today we go over where we communicate about our squad work. A tip or two on using Jira.And a naming issue I'd like as much
feedback from everyone on to improve.

## When to communicate on Jira or Slack/Teams

As most of the content for this blog series stems from, it all starts with a question:
'Jira is used to track workflow and Slack to communicate within the various squads. But Jira isnâ€™t really used for communication. Correct?
Just want to double-check before I correct someone.



A bit of guidance from our Squads Grandmaster @Luke Robbertse on when to communicate on Slack versus Jira:
Jira should be used for capturing comms related to a specific squad / outcome or key result. Commenting on Issues in Jira means a conversation is attached to that specific Issue.
Slack is used for general organisation (including setting squad meetings :face_with_raised_eyebrow:), collaboration, discussions and some Q+A. Where there is specific dialogue that adds content and context to a Squad or Outcome, that should be captured as a comment on the Jira Issue.

### A good question indeed and one desperate for an answer and a solution
We iterated over how to deal with this. We tried to come up with a good way for people to manage their own time commits to different squads. We thought of using sub links between our Issues on Jira and see if we could establish an intermediary link between a Person and the Squads they are mapped to, that included a time commitment measured in Hours Per Week. This was not going to work and required too much engineering in Jira. We then attempted using Airtable as a store of everyone's squad commitments and how many hours per week they were committing to each of their squads. This too was not a natural integration and a large amount of technical
resistance was surfacing as we went down this path.

We then realised that we were over thinking things for a potential future problem that we did not yet have. We were 
trying to create a way to specifically track and measure everyone's time and an over engineered approach at that.
We realised the need for a simpler way to address this and put the trust in our people to manage it themselves.
