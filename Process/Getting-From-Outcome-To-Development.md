## Getting Started
Outcomes should be considered the 'why' in the planning process. 'Why' are we doing this? It is a key input artifact for the planning process and their prioritisation drives the order in which work is done. When an ordered list of Outcomes is available, work can start on the highest priority Outcome to find solutions.

## Eating the Elephant
An appropriate set of Stakeholders and Developers work together to identify a set of 1 or more ways in which the Outcome can be achieved. This can be done through brainstorming or whatever approach is identified to be the most appropriate. Where mutually exclusive approaches are proposed the team can either make a choice on preference or it may be necessary to carry out some additional research to provide evidence on which to make a decision. This can be to prototype an approach or carry out A/B testing. The results of the experiment can then support the decision on which approach should be taken. This avoids a ["HiPPO"](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/HiPPOs-highest-paid-persons-opinions) based decision process.

With agreement on the approach, it can then be defined using Epics, Features and Stories as appropriate. These are recorded in the project backlog and can be then be prioritised and worked on according to to the methodology of choice (SCRUM, Kanban etc). With a prioritised list in the Backlog, development can start.

It may be that several Features are required in order to fulfill the KRs of the Outcome. When this is the case, the Features should be worked on and performance of the product against the KRs assessed as they are completed.

## Over-solving
It is possible that the KRs of the Outcome are satisfied before all of the proposed Features are implemented. When this occurs the stakeholders can decide to accept the product or not. 
If they accept the product the Outcome can be closed off. 
In the event of the Stakeholders not accepting the product, then a review of the KRs is necessary to identify what is missing. Care should be taken to avoid scope creep at this stage.

## Capturing Spontaneous Innovation
Casual conversations are often a rich source of innovation and ideas. It is important to capture the solutions that can germinate in these conversations. It is frequently the case that these are answers to problems that don't yet have a prioritised Outcome, they are solutions to problems that have not yet been identified. In this instance the solutions should be documented in the backlog as an Epic or Feature that can then be considered during the discovery phase when a suitable Outcome is prioritised. This storing of solutions in the Backlog can also be used when an Outcome is satisfied before all of its elicited Epics\Features have been completed.
